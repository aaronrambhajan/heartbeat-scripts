## Phase 1 data
- Compare and plot accuracies across learning and testing trials
- Compare RT distributions
- D’?????? idk
- What I did with trash data, because the data is reasonably similar? We’ll run some things in the next few days then touch base with Mike on Friday if we’re barking up the wrong fuckin tree
- Link accuracies to e-mails and find specific results (i.e. did you listen to music, or if they all ranked the same factors similarly?)
- High error sounds??? Like, maybe?

## Phase 1 survey data
- Compare ranking of heartbeat factors?
-  Describe interesting comments

## Phase 1 med-ppl data
- Accuracies
- Diving into they rationale was interesting, especially for the high error rate heartbeats?
- Level of fucking pattern detecting that’s going on here—it’s complicated
- Specific heartbeat sample correctness distributions to look at the highest error rate ones and maybe why?—maybe the recordings were too arbitrary or confusing, didn’t have the knowledge to filter through them properly, led us to generating our own sounds

## Phase 2 data
- Density plot 
- Think some more about it?
- Failed to calibrate it?
- RT distributions
