# Context
We're studying heartbeats. Something like... Digital Signal Processing and Cognitive Psychology and Cardiology in a single bucket. We want to understand how heartbeat sounds relate to their healthinessâ€“and how they relate to people's _perceptions_ of their healthiness.

## Folders
- `detection/` are my attempts at DSP signal detection.
- `processing/` are scripts that dealt with cleaning, organizing, and pairing real-world heartbeat samples.
- `synthesis/` are scripts for synthesizing heartbeat sounds.
